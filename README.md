### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist with a strong computer science engineering background. Iâ€™m currently working on Risk Analytics using NLP techniques at Verisk Analytics. 


When not at work I enjoy playing cricket, travel, cook and explore new cuisines. I am an amateur DJ; I love mixing tracks and play for friends and family.
